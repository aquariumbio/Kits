This library should probably be moved maybe??

This library is a list of kits that are used in lab.  This format works with the kits library methods in [CompositionHelper](https://github.com/aquariumbio/protocol-base/blob/main/composition_libs/libraries/compositionhelper/source.rb).  Reference the [Genome Center Protocols](https://github.com/aquariumbio/aq-genome-center) for example of kit use.
